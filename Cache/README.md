## Some instructions

- This is actually a really tough lab, because of the ambiguity of the "synchronization" of verilog.

- You should be very careful about the "<=" and "=", every trigger of "always @(*)", and the ambiguity "before the posedge" and "after the posedge".

- You can browse this repo to find the function of each delay "#?".

- Anyway, relax yourself and have fun :D
